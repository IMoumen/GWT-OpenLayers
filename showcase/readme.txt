The showcase is:  - set up according to the 'war' project structure (GWT 1.6 and up)  - set up as an eclipse projectTo run the showcase you need to:1) Get the Java EE download of Eclipse 3.4 or 3.5. The latest version of Eclipse can be obtained from:http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/For older versions check:http://wiki.eclipse.org/Older_Versions_Of_Eclipse2) Install the Google Eclipse plugin in Eclipse:http://code.google.com/intl/nl/eclipse/docs/getting_started.html3) Import the showcase in Eclipse as an existing project>File >Import >Existing Projects into Workspace4) Download 'openlayers_gwt-0.4.jar' and copy it to the lib directory5) Right click the project and select >Run As >Web applicationBy default OpenLayers is included from the Version API URL (see http://trac.openlayers.org/wiki/HowToDownload).If you want to run against a local version of OpenLayers, for example a debug version you compiled yourself, then you need to adjust 'GwtOpenLayersShowcase.html'. Change the following line in that html file:<script src="http://openlayers.org/api/2.8/OpenLayers.js"></script>into:<script src="YOUR_PATH_TO_OPENLAYERS"></script>For example:<script src="js/OpenLayers-2.8/OpenLayers.js"></script>Finally, you have to be online to run the showcase (or invest some effort into running your own WMS server, for example with GeoServer, and point your examples at that WMS server).Enjoy,The GWT-Openlayers team
